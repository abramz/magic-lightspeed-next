Put a Project Lightspeed stream behind login so it can be private

For now, it uses an allowlist of emails passed by an environment variable

- Built with [next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- Deployed to [vercel](https://vercel.com)
- Login w/ [magic.link](https://magic.link)
- Stream w/ [Project Lightspeed](https://github.com/GRVYDEV/Project-Lightspeed)
  - assumes the Ingest & WebRTC servers are running somewhere else

Based on various next.js & magic.link examples as well as [Project Lightspeed React](https://github.com/GRVYDEV/Lightspeed-react)
